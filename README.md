## Dev's Note üë©üèª
- Personally, there are minor tweaks and adjustments I can think of to adjust the bugs on this, it's just that I have gone over the bare minimum (in terms of the assignment requirements) so I'm leaving it at this. I worked on this *project* alone over the course of several, inconsecutive days so if you're going to use it as a reference, a credit would be appreciated! üíò
